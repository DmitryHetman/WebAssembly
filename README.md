WebAssembly
===========
This package aims to provide a few tools for working with [WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly) binaries from within JavaScript itself.

For now it contains a relevant type and opcode definitions and a streaming(!) WebAssembly reader in its early stages.

Feel free to contribute!
