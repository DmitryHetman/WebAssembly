WebAssembly
===========
This package aims to provide a few tools for working with [WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly) binaries from within JavaScript itself.

For now it contains a few loosely coupled type and opcode definitions and a streaming WebAssembly parser in its early stages.

Feel free to contribute!
